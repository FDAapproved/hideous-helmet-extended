# Hideous Helmet Extended

_Requires [HUDCore](https://github.com/dastrukar/hdest-hudcore) by Dastrukar_  
_Supports [Hideous Helmet](https://github.com/dastrukar/hideous-helmet) by Dastrukar_

Ever wanted your HUD to _feel_ like it was inside your HHelmet?  Would you like more control over your HUD Elements?  Well boy howdy do I have the add-on for you!  Loading this after HUDCore/HHelmet will add a new Helmet Overlay HUD Element, as well as update the existing HUD elements, to allow you to customize your HUD much more than before, not to mention make the HUD feel more diegetic and immserive!

### Examples
